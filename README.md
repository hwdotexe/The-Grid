# The Grid
Welcome to The Grid - an open-world hacking adventure, filled with addicting gameplay and loads of content. In The Grid, you take on the role of an aspiring hacker, whose only goal is to grow stronger. Level up your gear by hacking other players, as well as by hacking systems scattered around the map.

## Gameplay
In The Grid, you are a freelance computer enthusiast, with (coincidentally) all the right tools for the job. Your System is your life - it is what hacks and gets hacked, as well as refuels your battery. It sits in your first hotbar slot. Second is your list of Viruses - the arsenal of code that you use to attack other systems. Viruses can generate EXP, Bitcoins (in-game only), or both. Use them wisely! Players who are Level 5 or above also have a Traceroute, which can detect nearby systems and players. Finally, your Firewall is a device that when powered on reduces the chances of getting hacked.
