# The Grid
Welcome to TheGrid - an open-world hacking adventure engine! Aim your antenna at the closest System and prepare to discover its secrets. TheGrid is a server-wide gameplay mechanic which allows server owners to configure an endless world of interconnected devices. With laptop in hand, players can venture across the map hacking other players and preconfigured devices. This new gamemode isnâ€™t only a must-have for technology enthusiasts, but it requires zero hacking experience and is easy to understand.

## Tips, Tricks, and Helpful Information
Some viruses generate `EXP`. Some viruses generate `Bitcoin`. Some viruses can generate both. `EXP` is rewarded based on the level of the target system and virus type (stronger target and/or virus = more `EXP`). `Bitcoin` is generated randomly, but the `Adware` viruses has the highest probability and reward. Firewalls of any kind use 2x more power when turned on, which drains your battery faster. Traceroutes, outlets, and hacking are all limited to a short range and must be completed within the range to work. `Ice Cubes` will eliminate your cooldown wait-time, but melt after use. Cooldown wait-times are generated randomly based on your level. Players' hacking gear (`System`, `Firewall`, `Virus` set, `Traceroute`) upgrades every 10 levels and improves each time. `Outlets` give off a sparking particle effect every few seconds, and NPC systems an Enchantment Table effect. You cannot hack a system whose level is higher than your own, however stronger players can hack you (so watch out). When the `Firewall` is active, players have 5 extra "levels of protection". In other words, in order to be hacked, the hacker must be at least 6 levels stronger than the target. This only works when the firewall is active.

## Environment
Currently, this plugin demands a dedicated server environment. In other words, it overrides players' inventories, gamemode, actions, etc. It is highly recommended that you use a server that is dedicated to the game to play. Any other servers will see many errors. 1GB minimum RAM is recommended.

A city / town game map is recommended for game lore and purpose, however you may choose whichever map you like. For cities, I recommend using one of these excellent maps: `Varenburg`, `Imperial City` or `Vertoak` (none of which are mine!). 

## Building
Currently the best way to import this code is to clone the repository into your personal git directory, and import it into your Java IDE (I use Eclipse). If you have a better solution, such as downloading the .zip and going from there, please feel free to do that instead.

## License
This plugin was made by me. You didn't help. As long as you give credit, you're free to use this project in any way you please. You can fork it, hack at it (no pun intended), put it on your server, give it away at the company christmas party, etc. The only thing you can't do is sell it.
